  The sync protocol has changed for versions > 4.1.x
  If you have spamd installed in distributed environment 
  with sync enabled stop sync between the nodes until every 
  node is updated
  
  - sync for spamdb is now implemented (parameter -Y)
  - if you use cPanel build the port with -DCPANEL,
    spamd will be installed as obspamd and the rc script is obspamd.cpanel
