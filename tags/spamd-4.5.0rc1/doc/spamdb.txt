2008-01-06 	changes in spamdb

spamdb can now sync new entries to peers the parameter for sync is
the same as for spamd/spamlogd ( parameter -Y).

Use cases:
  - spamd installed at the gateway, the MTA on another machine.
    The MTA classifies no a sending server as spammer and trapps
    the sending server with spamdb and sync.
  - More than one MTA, you white/blacklist a server at MTA1 and
    this entry is synced to all other MTA's
  - offload greyscanner from the gateway/MTA's to separate machine
  
  Many more ideas...

Tip: create a wrapper script for easy usage

Example sspamdb wrapper script:

#!/bin/sh
PEERS="-Y IP.ADDR.PEER.1 -Y IP.ADDR.PEER.2"
spamdb ${PEERS} $@
