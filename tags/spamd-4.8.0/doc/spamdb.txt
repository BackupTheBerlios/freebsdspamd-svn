2008-01-06 	changes in spamdb

spamdb can now sync new entries to peers the parameter for sync is
the same as for spamd/spamlogd ( parameter -Y).

Use cases:
==========
  - spamd installed at the gateway, the MTA on another machine.
    The MTA classifies now a sending server as spammer and trapps
    the sending server with spamdb and sync.

  - You have more than one MTA, and you want to white/blacklist
    a sending server with a single command at MTA-1 - MTA-n
    in real time.

  - offload greyscanner from the gateway/MTA's to separate machine

  - Many more ideas...


Example wrapper script to use spamdb with sync:
===============================================

#!/bin/sh
PEERS="-Y IP.ADDR.PEER.1 -Y IP.ADDR.PEER.2"
spamdb ${PEERS} $@


Known bugs:
===========
  - spamdb sync does not work in multicast mode.
